# Smart_Garden_System-1

A Java-based computerized gardening system that simulates plant growth, survival, and health under dynamic environmental conditions. Built using Object-Oriented Programming principles, the system features modular subsystems for automated watering (including rain simulation), temperature regulation, and pest detection and treatment.

Utilizes JavaFX for an interactive and visually responsive UI with real-time plant state updates.

Implements an event-driven architecture with a custom EventBus for communication between subsystems (e.g., RainEvent, SprinklerEvent, ParasiteEvent).

Includes plant health modeling based on hydration, temperature thresholds, and parasite damage.

Supports randomized weather events and time-based day progression for realistic simulation.

Designed using Singleton, Observer, and Factory design patterns for modularity and scalability.

Achieved enhanced visualization with animations for rain, sun movement, and pest effects.
